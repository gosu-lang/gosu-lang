/**
    This doclet-independent package has a set of classes and
    interfaces that are the building blocks for doclets. They
    define the basic structure of doclets and make doclet
    writing much easier because they provide the content generation
    code to be shared among different doclets. Builders only provide
    the structure and content of API documentation.
    They will not provide any style markup.

    <p><b>This is NOT part of any supported API.
    If you write code that depends on this, you do so at your own risk.
    This code and its internal interfaces are subject to change or
    deletion without notice.</b>
