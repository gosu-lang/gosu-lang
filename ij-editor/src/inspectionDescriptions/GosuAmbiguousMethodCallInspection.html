Upgrade Gosu code that is making an ambiguous method call. <br>
<!-- tooltip end -->
Gosu allowed you to make some ambiguous method calls by choosing the best matching method for you. A warning was
generated to alert the user, while now an error is reported instead. <br>
This inspection allows you to upgrade your code so that it will continue to behave as before by calling the same method.
Special care must be taken as the ambiguous method call might mask a real logical error in the code.
<p>
    Note that under normal circumstances this inspection should be disabled as it was designed to be run just for the upgrade process.
